SINKIN SANS is a simple, pleasantly proportioned sans serif with tiny, inconspicuous notches that sink into verticals at the intersections of strokes adding highlights to congested corners. The incisions make right angles appear sharper and improve definition in more intricate glyphs. Although the nicks are barely noticeable they add emphasis to outlines and give a lift to shady nooks.
