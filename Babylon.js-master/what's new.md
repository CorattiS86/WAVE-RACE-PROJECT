  - **Breaking changes**
    - `VertexData.CreateLines()` removed as `MeshBuilder.CreateLines()` now calls `MeshBuilder.CreateLineSystem()`
    - `scene.onNewXXXAdded` and `scene.onXXXRemoved` callbacks were removed and replaced by `scene.onNewXXXAddedObservable` and `scene.onXXXRemovedObservable`
    - `Material.dispose` does not dispose textures by default. You have to call `material.dispose(false, true)` to get the previous behavior.
    - `SSAORenderingPipeline.getBlurHPostProcess` and `SSAORenderingPipeline.getBlurVPostProcess`. The SSAO rendering pipeline doesn't use standard blur post-process anymore. A bilateral blur post-process is used instead.
    - `Engine.bindBuffers` is now `Engine.bindBuffersDirectly` ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams))
    - `Engine.bindMultiBuffers` is now `Engine.bindBuffers` and strongly typed `{ [key: string]: VertexBuffer; }` of buffers ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams))
    - `Engine.createDynamicVertexBuffer` takes vertices rather than capacity, creating and initalizing in one gpu instruction ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams)) 
    - Internally new `Engine.bindBuffer` is used rather than `gl.bindBuffer` which only binds when the bound buffer is changing ([benaadams](https://github.com/benaadams)) 
    - `DynamicTexture` no longer forces height/width to exponents of 2 if MIP maps are disabled ([dahlbyk](https://github.com/dahlbyk))
