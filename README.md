# WAVE-RACE-PROJECT
This is a work for Computer Graphics (Master Engineering Computer Science). 

I was inspired by an old video game -> Wave Race 64.

It is developed using Babylon libraries from:
[Babylon JS](http://www.babylonjs.com/)

This project include the main techniques
used in Computer Graphics in addition to the management of polygonal models:
- Lights
- Textures
- Normal Mapping
- Bump Mapping
- Particles
- Water
- Collisions
- Animations

PS: the browser requires the permissions to access to file (in this case required to access to textures),
    then in according to your preffered browser remember to give it permission, otherwise you will not see the textures.
    
    CHROME:  1. Add the path of Chrome.exe in PATH of SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
             2. Execute Command Prompt with Administrator Privileges
             3. launch "chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files"
             
    FIREFOX:  1. write in the URL bar "about:config"
              2. set the field "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy = false"
